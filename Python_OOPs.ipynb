        "- The programming paradigm known as object-oriented programming (OOP) centers software design around objects as opposed to logic and functions.  Real-world entities are represented by objects, which have methods (functions) and attributes (data) that specify how they behave.  OOP is commonly utilized in contemporary programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript because it improves code reusability, modularity, scalability, and maintainability.\n",

        "1) Encapsulation -\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing necessary parts through controlled interfaces.\n",
        "It is achieved using private and public access modifiers.\n",
        "Example: In Python, private attributes are defined using an underscore _ or __.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Abstraction - The goal of abstraction is to conceal complexity and reveal only an object's most important characteristics.\n",
        "For instance, intricate internal mechanics (engine, fuel system) are concealed by an automobile's steering and accelerator controls.\n",
        "Abstract classes and interfaces are used in its implementation.\n",

        " It encourages code reuse and prevents code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4) Polymorphism - Objects of different classes can be regarded as belonging to the same superclass thanks to polymorphism.\n",

        "\n",
        " The process of presenting only the essential features to the user and concealing intricate technical details is known as abstraction.  Instead of emphasizing how an object does something, it concentrates on what it does.  Abstract classes and interfaces are frequently used to implement abstraction.  For instance, we can control the direction of an automobile by turning the steering wheel, but we are unaware of the intricate hydraulic or electronic systems that operate behind the wheel.  Abstract classes, which merely give method definitions without disclosing their actual implementation, are one way to achieve abstraction in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        " Conversely, encapsulation is the process of concealing an object's internal information and limiting direct access to it.  By regulating how data is altered or accessed, it guarantees data security and protection.  Programming languages' private, protected, and public access specifiers are used to implement encapsulation.  The engine of an automobile, for example, is enclosed within the hood to restrict direct access and guarantee that only approved systems can communicate with it.  Private attributes, which are indicated by a __ prefix, and getter and setter methods to manage data access are frequently used in Python to create encapsulation.\n",

Access modifiers, which limit direct manipulation of an object's data, are used to establish encapsulation, whereas abstract classes and interfaces are used to implement abstraction.  Together, these ideas improve object-oriented programming's modularity, maintainability, and code security."

        "\n",
        " 3) Frequently Used in Function Wrappers: In higher-order function contexts, this is frequently used in decorators and wrappers to make objects behave as callable functions.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4) Enhances Readability: __call__ offers a single entry point for carrying out functionality inside an object rather to defining several methods with clear names.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5) Beneficial for Stateful Functionality: It can work similarly to a function and save state information across several calls.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6) Allows for Custom Call Behavior: Classes that require function-like behavior can benefit from the ability for developers to alter what occurs when an instance is \"called.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "7) Used in Machine Learning and APIs: Models and layers in frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch use __call__ to dynamically handle incoming data."
